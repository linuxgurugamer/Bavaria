All are not necessary for installation, but recommend for better gameplay.

The integrated Docking port is compatible with a normal size stock one.

There are still some bugs and missing features...

usage and known issues:
to use the iva buttons and easier gameplay
please configure following actiongroups -> 1 for undock, decouple / 2 for the parachute deploy / 3 for toggle collar
after deployment of the parachute i recommend to turn retrograde off

on first spawn there is an errormessage in the VAB , it´s an known RPM issue and harmless ( RPM checks for the actions groups, you
usually define after spawning your vessel....)

there are two "control from here" entries, ksp creates two of them one for the vessel one for the build in docking port,
it does not matter witch one you use, both have the same node


FAQ:

Q:the floating collar raises my vessel not enough out of the water
A:it depends on the amount of fuel left, next time use fuel ;-)

Q: the bubble runs out of energy
A: you should do an emergency burn to land after undocking instead of hours of siteseeing 



Tubes info
weight and size-values and descriptions still more or less placeholders, some issues with welding/optical and some colliderissues.

But, for first feedback it is useable. In the science-section there is a first "minipart". a plant without animation.
